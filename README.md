Project Overview and Goals:

For a prospective student seeking to pursue higher studies in foreign countries, the process of selecting a university is a daunting task. The university selection involves considering various criteria during the application process, tailored to the individual's requirements. To tackle this challenge, the project aims to develop a recommender system utilizing diverse classification algorithms. By analyzing the student dataset and user profile, the system will generate a list of the top 10 universities that optimize the chances of successful admission for the student.
